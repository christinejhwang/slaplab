                        Neurofeedback allows some devices to claim that they can boost/improve one’s attention. This boost in attention comes from using specific brainwaves (i.e., alpha, beta, theta, etc.) to perform a task on an associated app. Because this task specifies a certain power needed in a given brainwave to work, by focusing one’s attention on the task, one should be able to (over time) boost or improve their attention levels.<br><br>

                        Through the analysis of one’s brainwaves, some devices claim that they can increase an individual’s brain performance through neurofeedback. This increase in brain performance comes from the devices letting the user know when their brainwaves (i.e., alpha, beta, theta, etc.) are not working in a systematic way. The theory behind this claim is that through neurofeedback an individual will be able to increase their brain performance by maintaining systematic brainwave activity.<br><br>

                        Devices that claim to be able to increase one’s mindfulness are tracking the brain activity (i.e., alpha, beta, theta, etc.) to see what the state of the individual brain is in. Then, through neurofeedback, the device informs the individual when their brain is in a relaxed/mindful state and encourages them to continue what they are doing. The thought behind this is that overtime individuals will be able to put themselves into a relaxed/mindful state based on the neurofeedback that they received.<br><br>

                        Brain-computer interface (BCI), in the context of consumer-based EEG devices, is when an individual can control something with their brain activity (i.e., alpha, beta, theta, etc.). For instance, some devices use the brain activity in an individual to have them control certain aspects of an app. This in turn, theoretically, would train the individual to be able to activate certain areas or pathways of their brain.<br><br>

                        The claim behind devices being able to increase one’s physical performance comes from neurofeedback associated with cognitive training. Some of these devices have individuals go through a series of cognitive tests, while providing neurofeedback to the individual. Theoretically, through this training, individuals will be able to put themselves into a mental state for peak physical performance.<br><br>

                        The claim that consumer-based devices can track and improve one’s sleep is based on the idea that the devices will be analyzing one’s brainwaves (i.e., alpha, beta, theta, etc.) while they sleep. These devices track the brain activity as one sleeps and based on their brain activity, wakes them up when their brain is in the right state.<br><br>

Then, through neurofeedback, the device informs the individual when their brain is in a calm/relaxed state and encourages them to continue what they are doing.

Then, through neurofeedback, the device informs the individual when their brain is in a meditative state and encourages them to continue what they are doing.

The aim of these devices is to detect abnormal mental states of individuals (i.e., anxiety, schizophrenia, etc.) and inform the user. This type of claim could be very beneficial to individuals who suffer from mental illness.<br><br>
